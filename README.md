# Concentric-Circle-Contrasting-Target
Many computer vision tasks can be simplified if special image features are placed on the objects to be recognized. A review of special image features that have been used in the past is given and then a new image feature, the concentric contrasting circle, is presented. The concentric contrasting circle image feature has the advantages of being easily manufactured, easily extracted from the image, robust extraction (true targets are found, while few false targets are found), it is a passive feature, and its centroid is completely invariant to the three translational and one rotational degrees of freedom and nearly invariant to the remaining two rotational degrees of freedom.
This project holds MATLAB code to detect Concentric Circle Contrasting targets, that can be used to perfor various operations. In this repository, a code has been placed to replace the CCCs with the picture of choice. 
Run the main.m to execute the code. Place a video and the picture ( to be inserted) in the same folder and change the names of the video file and the image in the main.m file as directed in the file itself.

Package: MATLAB 2017b or higher
